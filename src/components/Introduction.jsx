            Golgappe (also known as Panipuri, Semolina Puffs in different parts
            of India and the world) is one of the most loved street snacks in
            India and we want to share it with North America. That&apos;s why we
            have developed more than seven unique flavors for all kinds of
            tastes. We work hard to produce exceptionally new recipes like the
            Raj Kachori, Panipuri Shots, Chocolate Golgappa and many more. If
            you&apos;d like to join us spread an Indian street food franchise.
            Please visit the franchising page.
